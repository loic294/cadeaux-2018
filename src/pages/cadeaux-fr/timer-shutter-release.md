I will use the wired shutter release remote control to create unique picture. This type of remote is useful to capture shots where it's important for the camera to stay steady. It is also used to create [light trail](https://www.google.ca/search?newwindow=1&biw=1920&bih=969&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=abcNXNe6OYSJgge2p4HYBQ&q=sky+light+trails&oq=sky+light+trails&gs_l=img.3...9026.9838..10100...0.0..0.278.533.3j0j1......1....1..gws-wiz-img.......0i7i30j0i7i5i30j0i8i7i30.PlWv8QvZQH0) that require to capture to capture hundred of shots during a few hours. 

I do not need the exact model that is suggested below but it needs to work with the Canon T2i and the Canon 6d Mark II. It must also include a automatic interval shooting mode.
